# Hangman Game

## Description
The Hangman Game is a simple text-based game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game can be played in single-player mode, where a random word is chosen from a predefined list, or in multi-player mode, where one player inputs a word for the other to guess.

## Installation
To run the Hangman game, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository or download the `hangman.py` file.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `hangman.py` is located.
4. Run the game using the command:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

## Usage
1. When prompted, type `1` for single-player mode or `2` for multi-player mode.
2. In single-player mode, the game will randomly select a word from the list.
3. In multi-player mode, the first player will input a word for the second player to guess.
4. Players will guess letters one at a time. The game continues until the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of chances (10 incorrect guesses).
